The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag! 

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags). 

Some HTML elements will display correctly, even if you forget the end tag: However, never rely on this! Unexpected results and errors may occur if you forget the end tag! 

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>. 

HTML Attributes
    All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about elements
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value" 

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.

This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!
    
    For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0.
    
    Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (255), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 0.
    
    To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).
    
    To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).

    Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters:

    rgb(60,60,60)
    rgb(120,120,120)

RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with:

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

<p> is a block-level element, which stretches to fill the width of its container. Changing it to inline-block fixes that.

to show border only for the content

p.inline-border {
  display: inline-block;
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 4px;
}

The title should describe the content and the meaning of the page.

The page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO). The text is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

The <title> element:

defines a title in the browser toolbar
provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
displays a title for the page in search engine-results
So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible! 

The two most common display values are block and inline.

Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

HTML elements can belong to more than one class.

To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g. <div class="city main">

An HTML iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.

The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data)
The <head> element is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag
The <title> element is required and it defines the title of the document
The <style> element is used to define style information for a single document
The <link> tag is most often used to link to external style sheets
The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings
The <script> element is used to define client-side JavaScripts
The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page

The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block, or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).

The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px). The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

In this situation, using max-width will improve the browser's handling of small windows.
