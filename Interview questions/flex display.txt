display: flex	Turns container into a flexbox layout

justify-content	Controls alignment on main axis

align-items	Controls alignment on cross axis

flex-direction	Sets direction: row or column

flex	Makes items grow/shrink

align-content

This property only takes effect on multi-line flexible containers, where flex-wrap is set to either wrap or wrap-reverse). A single-line flexible container (i.e. where flex-wrap is set to its default value, no-wrap) will not reflect align-content.

align-self

This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.

flex-wrap

nowrap - flex items on a single line
wrap - multi line
