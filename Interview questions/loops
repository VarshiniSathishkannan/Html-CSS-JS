// 5 types of loops:

// while
// do while
// for of
// for in

// The JavaScript for in statement loops through the properties of an Object: Iterates through keys from which we can get the values 

const person = {fname:"John", lname:"Doe", age:25};

let t = "";
for (let x in person) {
  t += person[x]; 
}

// The JavaScript for of statement loops through the values of an iterable object.

// It lets you loop over iterable data structures such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists, and more:

const cars = ["BMW", "Volvo", "Mini"];

let text = "";
for (let x of cars) {
  text += x;
}

// while loop


while (cars[i]) {
  text += cars[i];
  i++;
}

do{
  text += cars[i];
  i++;
}while(cars[i]);
