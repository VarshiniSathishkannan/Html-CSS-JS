What is a Closure in JavaScript?
A closure is when a function “remembers” the variables from its outer scope, even after that outer function has finished executing.

In simple terms:

A closure gives inner functions access to outer function variables, even after the outer function is gone.

🧠 How It Works
Here’s an example:


function outer() {
  let count = 0;

  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();  // outer() returns inner
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
counter(); // 3
✅ What’s happening?
outer() runs and creates count

It returns the inner() function

counter is now a reference to inner()

Every time you call counter(), it still has access to count, even though outer() has already finished

That’s a closure in action.

📦 Why Are Closures Useful?
Closures let you:

Create private variables (data hiding)

Build stateful functions

Create function factories

Manage callbacks and async code (like setTimeout, event listeners)

🔐 Example: Private Variables

function secretNumber() {
  let secret = 42;

  return {
    getSecret: () => secret,
    setSecret: (newSecret) => { secret = newSecret; }
  };
}

const obj = secretNumber();
console.log(obj.getSecret()); // 42
obj.setSecret(99);
console.log(obj.getSecret()); // 99
You can’t access secret directly, but the functions can — that's closure magic. ✨

📊 Real-World Use Case: setTimeout

function delayedMessage(msg) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(msg);
  }, 1000);
}

delayedMessage("Hello!"); // Logs "Hello!" after 1 sec
Even though delayedMessage finishes immediately, the arrow function remembers msg because of the closure.

⚡ TL;DR
A closure is formed when a function keeps access to its outer scope, even after the outer function has returned.

🧠 It’s what enables:

Private variables

Stateful functions

Asynchronous behavior

Functional patterns
