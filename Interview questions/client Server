Client side and Server side ?

Client-Side
This is everything that happens in the user's browser (the "client").

Examples:
Clicking a button and seeing a popup

Animations on a page

Form validation (e.g., showing an error if a field is empty)

Loading new content without refreshing (like on Instagram or Twitter)

Client-Side Technologies:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks like React, Vue, Angular

Runs in your browser

Why use client-side?
Faster interactions (no need to talk to the server every time)

More responsive UI

Great for single-page apps (SPAs)

Server-Side
This is everything that happens on a web server, behind the scenes.

Examples:
Logging into your account

Saving form data to a database

Getting personalized recommendations

Serving pages or data to the client

Server-Side Technologies:
Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), PHP, Ruby, Java, Go

Databases like MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

Logic runs on a remote server

Why use server-side?

Secure operations (like handling passwords)

Access to databases

Dynamic content (like showing your personal dashboard)

ü§ù How They Work Together
When you visit a website:

The server sends HTML/CSS/JS files to your browser.

The client displays the page and might use JavaScript to make it interactive.

If you need data (e.g., your messages), JavaScript makes a request to the server, which responds with the data.
